  HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page.<br>
  For example <img src="lport.jpg">
  So, what is HTML used for? Web developers use it to organize, format, and display a web page’s content. Read on to learn more about how HTML works, how HTML5 improved its functionality, and the different careers that use it.

How does HTML work?
<br><p>
    HTML is usually stored in files that use the .htm or .html extension. A website can include hundreds or even thousands of these HTML files kept in various directories.

When you visit a web page, its server sends its HTML files to your browser. Your browser then reads the HTML in the files and displays it. Some web applications don’t use static HTML but generate it in response to specific actions on their servers.

We can also add other types of content, like CSS and JavaScript files, images, and videos, to add more features to a web page. CSS allows us to add stylistic elements (like colors) to a webpage. JavaScript enables interactivity. Together, these three languages form the foundation of web development.

</h2>Here’s an example:<img src="Coe.jpg" alt="">



In the HTML example above, the first element we see is <div>, which wraps around the other elements. Div is one of the most common HTML elements and is a simple way to separate a page into sections. For example, if you wanted to create two columns on a web page, you could use div elements to define them.

Nested inside the div, we see an <h1> element. H1 elements define the main heading of a web page. The text within a heading will usually be larger and bolder, depending on the styles applied to the page.

The <p> tag creates a paragraph element. There will usually be a margin after the element, again, depending on the styles.

Finally, we see a few sets of nested elements. The <ul> tag creates an unordered list, which does nothing until you nest at least one set of list elements (<li>) within it. A browser would render these elements as something like this:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
    
      <div>
  							<label>Name</label><br>
  							<input type="text" placeholder="Name" required>
  						</div>
  						<div>
  							<label>Email</label><br>
  							<input type="email" placeholder="Email Address">
  						</div>    
  						  <div id="h1">
  							<label>Password </label><br>
  							<input type="password" placeholder="enter here " required>
  						</div>
  						
  						<div>
  							<label>Message</label><br>
  							<textarea placeholder="Message"></textarea>
  						</div>     
  
  						<button style="width :50px;height :25px;border-radius:11px;background-color :##e877ee;color :#4615ff;" type="submit">				
  						    <a href="https://mutepairejonah@gmail.com/ ">SEND</button> </a>
  						    
	  <div id="h1">
  							<label>Rate us  </label><br>
  							<input type="range" placeholder="enter here " required>
  						</div>
